Example for how to use Queeky's API
http://www.queeky.com/api

First you must setup your account and get your API key here:
http://www.queeky.com/api/settings

The example contains three files:

1. index.php -> the page that serves the drawing tools via API
2. submit.php -> the script that saves drawings from app to gallery
3. gallery.php -> a small gallery script that displays all drawings by category
